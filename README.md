# The 80/20 Rule

To keep the Localeyz codebase as clean and simple as possible, we will only consider approving features that we feel at least 80% of our user-base will find valuable. If your feature request falls within the 20% range, it is considered an edge-case where you can directly sponsor the feature through a capital contribution.

# Code of Conduct
The Localeyz Code of Conduct (opens new window)is one of the ways we put our values into practice. We expect all of our staff, contractors and contributors to know and follow this code.

Our contributors and maintainers work extremely hard to build the Localeyz Platform. Please be respectful of those efforts throughout our ecosystem. Trolling, harassing, insulting, or other unacceptable behavior by participants will not be tolerated.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
Focusing on what is best for the Cooperative
Showing empathy towards other members
